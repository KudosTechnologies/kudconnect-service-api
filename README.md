## Description

Welcome to our project template for Modular Monolith Architecture! This template is designed to help you quickly get started with building modular applications following the Ports and Adapters pattern at module level. It has been carefully crafted with best practices that encourages clean and maintainable code.

### Key Features

- **Modular Monolith:** The application is organized into separate modules, each encapsulating distinct business capabilities. This structure enables clear separation of concerns while maintaining the simplicity of a monolithic application.
- **Ports and Adapters:** Also known as Hexagonal Architecture, this design principle isolates the application's core logic from specific technology implementations (like databases, UI, or third-party integrations). This makes the code more portable and easier to test, as these external concerns can be plugged in or unplugged without affecting the core logic.
- **API-First Approach:** We believe in designing the API before writing the code. This means you can expect a well-documented, intuitive API that forms a contract guaranteeing the behavior of the application.
- **Unit & Acceptance Tests:** Our project template includes examples of both unit tests (which test individual components in isolation) and acceptance tests (which test the system end-to-end). These examples are designed to help you write your own tests and promote a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
